# Introduction
This module mainly only exists because asynch macros are not supported as of 0.7.9. Its purpose is to allow awaiting when dealing cards from multiple decks.

This is made to help play my personal use "Founders of Catan", an implementation of Settlers of Catan that I made for fun and to game with my friends in the age of COVID. It intentionally contains copyrighted art (based on physical assets that I legally own), and probably also copyrighted rules, and IS NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED IN ANY WAY. 

Seriously. I will f***ing cut you.
